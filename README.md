# To-do-List

This is a project made just for fun and practice.

It features:
* A menu for users to create their own to-do's, which can later be edited, marked as completed and/or deleted.
* Usage of a third party library to make to-do's draggable and droppable to rearrange them.
* Usage of local storage to save and display the user's to-do's.
* An input which allows the user to search for specific todos.
* A settings menu which allows the user to customize their experience on the webpage.
* An accessible UI that follows the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1.

To build it I used the following:
* React
* Redux
* Sass
